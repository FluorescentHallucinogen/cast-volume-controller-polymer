#cast-volume-controller
This element represents the volume bar.  It handles both the volume bar in the main player bar
and in the cast controller element.  It publishes 2 properties:

castManager - the castManager object
cast - boolean defining if it's purely for cast.

The element uses flexbox to grow to fill up the size of the element.

#Setup
Use [Bower](http://bower.io/) to include the cast-volume-controller in your web app.  The following 
command will add the cast-volume-controller and it's dependencies to your project.

    bower install --save googlecast/cast-volume-controller-polymer
    
#Integration
The easiest way to integrate is to use one of the already provided elements which contain 
cast-button.  The instructions below cover a custom integration.  You'll need to first include 
[Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/start/getting-the-code.html).

##Including the element
In your html include the element

    <link rel="import"
        href="bower_components/cast-volume-controller-polymer/cast-volume-controller-polymer.html">
        
Add the element to your HTML defining whether it'll be used in the cast control bar.  And pass it
 the castManager object.
 
    <cast-volume-controller id="volume_controller"
        cast="true" castManager="{{ castManager }}"></cast-volume-controller>
